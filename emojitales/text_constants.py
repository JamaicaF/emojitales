APP_INTRODUCTION = f"""Can we tell stories using only emoji? 
Emoji Tales is inspired by the work of Warja Lavater. 
Lavater was a 20th-century artist, best known for her books that retold classic fairytales. 
Her storybooks only contained symbols, not words or pictures.   
\n
In that spirit, Emoji Tales translates stories from text to emoji.
\n
All sample texts are from D. L. Ashliman's "Folktexts: A Library of Folktales, Folklore, Fairy Tales, and Mythology."
